The law of large numbers tells us to expect that: as the sample size increases, the sample proportion of approvers should tend to be closer to the population proportion of approvers.  Note that we are also using sampling to approximate the distribution of sample proportions; we are sampling 2,000 times rather than taking all possible samples.  That means that rerunning either cell will give you a slightly different histogram.  But the phenomenon here is due entirely to the sample size (50 versus 995), not the number of simulations."
