-More practice writing code in discussion

I think it would help us learn how to apply the concepts because sometimes I feel like what we learn in lecture and what we do in lab are two separate things","5","4","The way you guide during office hours helps a lot. I think maybe something I would appreciate just for myself is having more practice problems during office hours. When joseph gave us the swimmer example before the midterm to do in office hours it really helped me understand the concept a lot better"
