    "Welcome to the second lab!  Today, you'll dive right into programming in Python.  Repeated practice in labs is probably your the most important tool for learning Python and succeeding in this course.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. (The normal way) Come to your lab section and work on the lab as directed. Before you leave, you need to submit the lab **and** have a staff member check you off to confirm that you came to lab section and attempted to make progress while you were there. In this case, your grade will be defined as:\n",
    "$$\\min(\\frac{\\text{Number of completed questions} } { {\\text{Completion threshold} } }, 100\\%)$$\n",
    "    The staff will determine the completion threshold based on the progress we reasonably expect you to make for a good effort during the lab section.  It will often be less than the total number of questions.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. (The hard way) If you complete the entire lab so that all tests pass and submit it by 11:59pm on the day when lab section meets, then you don't need to physically attend lab.  Your grade will be defined as the proportion of completed questions:\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\text{Number of completed questions} } { { \\text{Total number of questions} } }$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborating on labs is more than okay -- it's encouraged! You should rarely be stuck for more than a few minutes on questions in labs, so ask a neighbor or an instructor for help. (Explaining things is beneficial, too -- the best way to solidify your knowledge of a subject is to explain it.) Please don't just share answers, though.\n",

And we thought where would be a better place to confirm his findings than on the Moon. And so we thought we'd try it here for you. The feather happens to be, appropriately, a falcon feather for our Falcon. And I'll drop the two of them here and, hopefully, they'll hit the ground at the same time. \n",
